# CD-03 Little Vicar - 12" Arcade Stick Enclosure


*This readme is temporary, and I intend to create more detailed documentation in the future.*


There are two versions: the thick is meant for arcade sticks and has more clearance, while the thin is meant for button only controllers. The thinner version has little clearance and will require bending the contacts on arcade buttons.

The mid and side panels are designed to be cut on 1/4 inch acrylic. The top and bottom panels do not require a specific acrylic thickness.

You need both the top and the mid panel for whichever layout you want to use. I currently only have 2 layouts: Sega 2p and All-Button (Stickless).

Pick whichever side panels fit your needs:

The switch panel is meant for a 20mm round switch such as this (note that it's held in entirely by friction in the current design): https://focusattack.com/mini-round-2-pin-spdt-on-off-rocker-switch-black/

The Neutrik panel is meant for either a neutrik D connector, or can be used for a switch as above by using an adapter.

The button panel is meant for a standard 24mm arcade button.

In my builds, the corner panels were printed with the black resin from JLCPCB. I have not tested with other materials.

## Assembly Hardware

8x M4 x 8.2mm Heat Set Inserts (https://www.mcmaster.com/94459A170/) for the corners.

6x M4 x 12mm screws for the top panel (focus attack's madcatz top panel screws do work for this if you want some anodized colors)

6x M4 12 mm screws for bottom. I use countersunk screws for these but obviously, this does require countersinking if you go this route.

16x M4 x 16mm screws for sides
16x M4 nuts for sides

2x M4 x 31 mm female threaded hex standoffs (aluminum is cheapest, https://www.mcmaster.com/95947A065/) (also consider nylon https://www.mcmaster.com/92319A399/). These help prevent the top and bottom panels from bowing out if there's pressure from the wiring.
