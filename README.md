# CD-03 Little Vicar
 12" Arcade Stick Enclosure

8x M4 x 8.2mm Heat Set Inserts (https://www.mcmaster.com/94459A170/)

6x M4 x 12mm screws for the top panel (focus attack's madcatz top panel screws do work for this if you want some anodized colors)

6x M4 12 mm screws for bottom. I use countersunk screws for these but obviously, this does require countersinking if you go this route.

16x M4 x 16mm screws for sides
16x M4 nuts for sides

2x M4 x 31 mm female threaded hex standoffs (aluminum is cheapest, https://www.mcmaster.com/95947A065/) (also consider nylon https://www.mcmaster.com/92319A399/)
